# Terms to understand

- Feature Scaling - Scaling/ Resizing the values of a feature. This helps gradient descent run faster
- Feature Engineering - Adding features by combinig available features if they make contextual sense.
- Regularization - Changing the cost function so that overfitting can be avoided. Uses another hyperparameter, $\lambda$.
