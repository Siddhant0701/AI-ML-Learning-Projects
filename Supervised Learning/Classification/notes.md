# Classification
- Also called Logistic Regression. This helps in binary classification.

- The process is almost the same as linear regression except that the cost function is a bit different.
- Uses the sigmoid funcion which ouputs values closer to 0 or 1.
- The main function function used is $f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(wx+b)}}$

- Classification is done similarly on multiple features bu extending w and x to be vectors rather than values.
